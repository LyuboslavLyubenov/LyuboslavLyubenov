# 👋 Hey, my name is Lyubo

I'm a fullstack developer with over 8 years of professional experience. My career has spanned across various sectors including insurtech, energy, public transport, and education. I've participated in the development of products that are used by millions of people. 

My primary tech stack includes React, Node.js, TypeScript, C#, and React Native. I love building easy to use, easy to understand, testable and scalable frontends. On the backend I mostly use nodejs and c# - depending on the project and team. 

Recently i've been learning infrastructure as code, aws, azure. Apart from my hard skills, im working on improving my soft skills. 

I always try to learn new things and to help others. You can always find me helping others on [testing-library](https://testing-library.com/)'s [discord](https://discord.com/invite/testing-library).

I love to bike, code, lift weights and play video games. I also have two black chunky cats that I love very much. :octocat: :octocat:
